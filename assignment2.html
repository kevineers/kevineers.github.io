            <h1>Kevin Kuo's Assignment 2!</h1>
            <p>
            Assignment 2 was about creating a circuit with LEDs using digital and analog capabilities
            to control the LEDs' brightnesses and a button to initiate action(s) depending on its state.

            <h3>Schematic</h3>
            <p>
            <img src="assignment2_schematic.jpg" width=400></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            As seen in the above schematic, the circuit contains 2 LEDs—one red, one blue—and a 5V power source.
            The red LED was connected to pin 10 while the blue LED was connected to pin 9. These pins were selected
            because they allowed for analog writing, as indicated by their tildes (~).
            Just for easier wiring later, all resistors selected were 220 ohms. For the red LED, 5V-1.8V / 0.02A = 160 ohms
            and for the blue LED, 5V-3.3V / 0.02A = 85 ohms. Two different pins were used to allow for easier controlling
            of each LED so they may turn on and off independently.

            <h3>Circuit (Image)</h3>
            <p>
            <img src="assignment2_image.jpg" width=400></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            In the image, both blue and red LEDs are on, indicating that it is in the middle of running, 
            initiated by a press of the pushbutton. Both sides of the breadboard are used to provide 
            for more space to work with the button and LEDs. As a result, to complete the LEDs' circuits, a
            black ground wire connects one grounding side of the breadboard to the other grounding side. 
            The pushbutton's circuit includes a connection to Pin 2, allowing for any changes in state to be detected.
            That is, whether it is pushed, closing the loop and letting current flow through, or whether it is not pushed,
            leaving a gap between the 5V power source and ground (an incomplete circuit). Meanwhile, the two LEDs follow
            the same simple circuit pattern of pin --> LED --> resistor --> ground. The button was placed at one extended
            of the LEDs instead of in the middle so it was easier to press among the tangle of wires and resistor/LED legs.

            <p>
            The code used included snippets and functions mentioned in the class slides. An additional
            function, "random," was used and its documentation can be found here: 
            https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/random-numbers/random/. The random function
            was used to determine an integer (between 1 and 3) to use as the delay in ms for adjusting the 
            fade speed. Instead of hardcoding the numbers in manually, I settled with generating random ints. 
            While I initially struggled to get the LED to continue fading after the button was pressed (initially,
            I put all the button-fading into the loop itself), the solution was to create a new method (flashLed) to call
            another method (lightLoop) that could then (1) generate the delay in ms and (2) control the 
            fading speed and actual fades of the 2 LEDs itself. To declare a delay variable upon initialization 
            of a method, I double-checked documentation from here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/FunctionDeclaration. 
            During the button push run, analogWrite is used to allow for smooth and gradual fading of the LED lights. However, 
            once back to the original states (off for red, on for blue), digitalWrite is used as the LEDs only 
            need to be on/off (or high/low).

            The GIF shows the two LED lights turning on and off, but in opposites to each other, so when the red LED starts
            to become brighter, the blue LED starts to become dimmer and vice versa. While it might look like the two LEDs
            are "working together," in reality, the blue LED's brightness is dependent on how bright the red LED is, 
            but the red LED's brightness is not dependent on the blue LED. The original state of the LEDs is on for 
            blue and off for red. At the end of each button push run, the LEDs return to the original state.
