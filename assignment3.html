            <h1>Kevin Kuo's Assignment 3!</h1>
            <p>
            Assignment 3 was about creating a circuit with a sensor in a voltage divider to change an LED. 
            On the software end of things, it was about using analogRead, analogWrite, the map function, and 
            an if statement.
            </p>
            <p>
            Alas, due to upcoming midterms, I only attempted the bare minimum amount of experimentation to 
            meet the assignment requirements. :(

            </p>
            <p>
            As seen in the above schematic, the circuit contains 1 photoresistor and 1 red LED. The photoresistor
            was connected to A0, which allowed for analog reading (input). Meanwhile, the red LED was 
            connected to pin 9 , which allowed for analog writing (output), as indicated by its tilde (~) symbol.
            For the red LED, 5V-1.8V / 0.02A = 160 ohms minimum. The 220 ohm resistor was selected. 
            The smallest amount of resistance produced by the photoresistor was about 440 ohms when left at my normal room brightness.
            A 5K ohm resistor was selected for the portion containing the photoresistor to reduce power consumption. 
            When at its brightest, the A0 input pin may get a reading as high as 4.95 V. 
            (Calculation: 5-0 = I * 5,440 --> I = 0.0000919 --> 5-Vout = I * 440 --> Vout = 4.95V)
            By using a higher resistor at the end, the LED will pretty much never go completely dark 
            since the voltage change caused by the photoresistor would be miniscule. A lower value resistor, 
            like 220 ohms would cause the LED to be dimmer overall, since there would be less remaining voltage after the 
            photoresistor, and it was easier to make the LED go completely dim.

            <h3>Circuit (Image)</h3>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
            In the image, the red LED is shown at its brightest, when the photoresistor is left uncovered. 
            The image shows a very simple setup with the photoresistor going into analog input and the LED 
            being controlled by the analog output. The higher resistor value chosen for the part with the photoresistor
            created a less significant change in brightness, but was also "smoother" per se, probably due to 
            less change in brightness over time (but that can be adjusted by how quickly the LED is obscured too.)
            The 220 ohm resistor was chosen for the red LED to help exacerbate the amount of brightness change visible.
            It would be difficult to see the change in LED brightness if the LED was already dim due to a high resistor value.

            The code is based off of the Arduino sample code titled "AnalogInOutSerial." However, it's been adjusted to 
            include an if statement and to be tailored for a photoresistor rather than a potentiometer.
            Using the photoresistor sensor values, the software then accounts for the differing bits used in analog input/output
            and maps the analog input values to analog output values with the map function.

            Another chunk of code then checks if the sensor input value is a new high (max) or a new low (min).
            If it is either a new high or new low, it will then add an additional "NEW HIGH" or "NEW LOW" message
            in the Serial Monitor corresponding to the new record value. Otherwise, the serial monitor will continue to
            print the sensor input and converted output values in the serial monitor with slightly diffferent capitalized labels.
            
            The delay in milliseconds was increased to a point where the LED's brightness was still fairly smooth, but also 
            allowed for changes in the high/low sensor values to still be readable in the serial monitor.

            The GIF shows the red LED light becoming dimmer when the photoresistor is covered up. The red LED then increases
            in brightness again once the photoresistor is exposed to the previous brighter level of light.
