            <h1>Kevin Kuo's Assignment 1!</h1>
            <p>
            Assignment 1 was about creating a circuit with at least 3 LEDs capable of blinking independently.
            It's our first assignment as HCDE 439 students, so we're still getting the hang of things! :)

            As seen in the above schematic, the circuit contains 5 LEDs of different colors—
            red, yellow, green, blue, and white. These were all the single-color LED variations
            provided in our starter kit. I wanted to try out all the colors and see what they were like.
            For ease of wiring, all resistors were 220 ohms, which meet the minimum 160 ohms of resistance 
            required for even the LEDs with the greatest voltage drops of 1.8V. (Calculation: 5V-1.8v / 0.02A)

            Here, we see the entire breadboard with the red LED lighting up. A better view
            can be found in the top-down image below. As will be seen shortly, there were 
            three different approaches used to wire the LEDs.

                Through the top-down view, it's more clear that the top LED (red) had more complex
                wiring than the bottom three LEDs. The first approach (red LED) involved using 4 wires (pin-to-board, 
                LED-to-board, board-to-ground, and ground to ground pin).
                This was the most complex and was messy and took up the most space. The second approach (yellow LED) 
                used 3 wires (pin-to-board, board-to-ground, and ground to ground pin). A slight improvement!
                The final approach (green, blue, and white LEDs) only required 2 wires (pin-to-board, and ground to ground pin). 
                The final approach was inspired by an example from Sparkfun here: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sik-experiment-guide-for-arduino---v32/experiment-4-driving-multiple-leds.
                It showed me that the resistor can be directly plugged into the ground side of the board, reducing one wire. 
                It was interesting to find out that the resistor can be located either before or after the LED—it didn't matter. 
                As long as the resistor was in the circuit somewhere, the LED would be protected.
                On the flip side, it was still important to keep the anode and cathode sides of the LED in the proper position. 
                Cathode points negative/ground, and anode points positive/power supply.

            Luckily, much of the assignment could use code shown as example code in 
            the class slides and found in the public domain here: http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ForLoop.
            While similar, some modifications were made. Namely, the pins were changed to 
            appropriately map to the pins used for my version of the circuit, and the delay was changed to 400 ms. 
            The delay was extended to provide a more calming speed. The original
            100 ms was fairly intense to look at—lots of flashing lights in too short
            of a timespan.

            The GIF shows the LED lights turning on and off in order, from left to right,
            or bottom to top (pins low to high), then reversing. The simple sequence 
            is more pleasing to the eyes and smooth compared to if the lights were turned on and off
            out of order, or if it hopped from the end back to the start.
