            Hi, my name is Kevin Kuo! I'm from San Jose, California. Believe it or not, I enjoy
            the move from sunny weather to a more mild climate. The clouds are pretty pretty and 
            the temperature makes for great hiking weather. Not to mention, there's snow up here!
            Within UW, I'm an HCDE and marketing major and excited to learn pretty much 
            anything in this class—it's been a while since I've done any physics or electrical thingies. 
            I'm looking forward to how it seems very hands-on and well... physical... unlike a lot of 
            projects in HCDE that are digital.
