            Hi, my name is Kevin Kuo! I'm from San Jose, California. Believe it or not, I enjoy
            the move from sunny weather to a more mild climate. The clouds are pretty pretty and 
            the temperature makes for great hiking weather. Not to mention, there's snow up here!
            Within UW, I'm an HCDE and marketing major and excited to learn pretty much 
            anything in this classâ€”it's been a while since I've done any physics or electrical thingies. 
            I'm looking forward to how it seems very hands-on and well... physical... unlike a lot of 
            projects in HCDE that are digital.

              <a href="assignment1.html"><h2>Assignment 1: Blink!</h2>
                  <img src="assignment1.JPG" width=250></a>
                <p>
		Assignment 1 about creating a circuit with at least 3 LEDs capable of blinking independently.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="assignment">
              <a href="assignment2.html"><h2>Assignment 2: Fade!</h2>
                  <img src="assignment2_image.jpg" width=250></a>
                <p>
		Assignment 2 was about creating a circuit with LEDs and a button using digital and analog capabilities!
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="assignment">
                <a href="assignment3.html"><h2>Assignment 3: Input Output!</h2>
                    <img src="assignment3_image.jpg" width=250></a>
                  <p>
        Assignment 3 was about creating a circuit with a sensor in a voltage divider to then use both hardware 
        and software to change an LED.
                  </p>
              </div>
            <div class="assignment">
                <a href="assignment4.html"><h2>Assignment 4: High(er) voltage and transistors!</h2>
                    <img src="assignment4_image.jpg" width=250></a>
                  <p>
        Assignment 4 was about using a transistor to separately control load power from logic power.
                  </p>
              </div>
              <div class="assignment">
                <a href="assignment6.html"><h2>Assignment 5 + 6: Talking to the web and the web talks back!</h2>
                    <img src="assignment6_image.jpg" width=250></a>
                  <p>
        To save time to work on the final project, I combined Assignment 5 and 6 together. Together, they were 
        about using p5.js to create interaction between an Arduino and a webpage.
