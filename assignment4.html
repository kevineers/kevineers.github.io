            <h1>Kevin Kuo's Assignment 4!</h1>
            <p>
            Assignment 4 was about creating a circuit with a N-MOSFET transistor to separate load power from logic power. 
            We also needed to use analogWrite(), a high-load output device, and an input sensor that utilizes a library.

            There were a total of three separate chunks, or parts, to the entire component. I found it easiest to imagine each
            as its own part, albeit having all the grounds connected. The first chunk was the part with the N-MOSFET transistor
            and the LED strip powered by a 12V/2A external power supply, controlled by pin 9. The 2nd chunk had the IR receiver, 
            controlled by pin 7 and powered by the built-in 5V pin. The 3rd chunk was a piezo buzzer connected to pin 11 with a 
            100 ohm resistor.

            <h3>Circuit (Image)</h3>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
            This first image shows the entire circuit while the LED strip is on. The LED strip uses 12V and is 18W, so using the 
            P = V*I equation, we can find that 18W/12V = 1.5A, which is within the maximum of 2A supplied by the adapter. 
            No additional resistor is needed since each individual LED is in parallel and has a resistor already. Meanwhile, 
            the N-MOSFET transistor has a maximum rating of 60V and 30A (https://pdf1.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/view/171275/UTC/30N06L.html).
            As an aside, for the final project, I'm thinking of using a 2 meter NeoPixel RGBW LED strip. Using a save 60mA per LED calculation,
            I figured I needed a power source (5V max) with a 10A output to be able to handle the LEDs, so I'll have to buy another adapter. 
            The contrast from the LED strip makes it difficult to see, so there is a second image below with the lights off 
            and with a focus on the breadboard. 
            </p>

            <p>
              <img src="assignment4_image2.jpg" width=400></a>
              </p>
              <p>
              In this image, it is easier to see what's on the breadboard. The IR receiver is hooked up to the MCU. According to 
              its data sheet (https://html.alldatasheet.com/html-pdf/1132465/ETC2/VS1838B/111/1/VS1838B.html), the IR receiver 
              can handle up to 5.5V, so using the 5V pin works perfectly. Using the multimeter, it looks like the accompanying 
              board the IR receiver is on includes an internal resistor, so no external resistor is used. 

              For the piezo buzzer, a 100 ohm resistor is used for the sake of decreasing the buzzing noise—it just got too annoying
              when completely unrestricted. The piezo was controlled via pin 11.

            The code is based off of Derek Repsch's post in the HCDE 439 Slack—he helped me become aware of the existence of 
            switch and case, which I was then able to search for documentation online to use (https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/structure/control-structure/switchcase/).
            Instead of converting the signal to HEX code, I just used the non-HEX numerical results for cases. 
            Since I had a piezo buzzzer tone function "and" an IR receiver being used at the same time, an error would occur where the two 
            would use the same timer, causing a compilation error. The fix (https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=120955.0) was to hop into the Arduino documents folder, find the IRremote library,
            and edit a couple lines in the "boarddefs.h" file to remove the interference. The piezo buzzer was added as a way to signal to a user 
            that the program is ready to take the next signal from the remote, since sometimes a button could possibly take longer
            to run through all steps if it were programmed more complex—in this case, it was just turning on and off the light, but the audio 
            cue was still nice to have.

            The GIF shows the remote's decrease volume being pressed to turn off the LED strip and the remote's increase volume 
            button being pressed to turn on the LED strip. With a little more programming, each button could cause the LED strip 
            to react in a specific way. Unfortunately, the GIF does not have audio, but also imagine the piezo buzzer buzzing 
            after each button press!
