            <h1>Kevin Kuo's Assignment 5 + 6!</h1>
            <p>
            Assignment 5 and 6 were about creating interaction between an Arduino and a webpage. That is, the Arduino's sensors
            should cause a change in the webpage, and a change in the webpage should cause a change in the Arduino. The 
            requirements were to use at least two input sensors, one output device, JSON parsing, Serial.print, and p5.js.

            There were two parts of the circuit being used. One involved the control joystick, which requires power, ground, and wires for the X, Y, 
            and click values. However, I did not use the click part of the control joystick—it appears that this unit was faulty and 
            the clicks (when the joystick is pushed down and the audible click sound made) do not register with the Arduino. The second circuit 
            was for the output part, which would cause the yellow LED to light up whenever the mouse was pressed. As whas been done in the past, 
            the P=IV equation was used to confirm the minimum amount of resistance needed, 160 ohms (5V-1.8V / 0.02A). Thus, the 220 ohm resistor 
            was chosen as it was above the minimum, but not by too much.

            Here, the circuit with the two distinct parts is visible. The control joystick was placed at the extreme edge of the breadboard to allow 
            full down movements for the joystick. It also provided an easier time wiring up the joystick to the Arduino, since the wires could be 
            placed behind the joystick and plugged into the Arduino without super long wires. The yellow LED part was fairly straightforward, with the 
            resistor there to prevent infinite current. To finish up, both the control joystick and LED are connected to ground.

  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

  // Store Y val from control joystick

  digitalWrite(5, LOW);
  // Wait a moment before looping again
  delay(20);
}

// Check to see if anything was received from Serial
void recvOneChar() {
 // Mouse click creates the letter "p" to be transferred over, resulting in a value greater than 0
 if (Serial.available() > 0) {
 // Save the received character to a variable
 receivedChar = Serial.read();
 // Set the newData variable to true to indicate the presence of new data, and a mouse being pressed
 newData = true;
 }
}

 if (newData == true) {
  // If new data exists, print out a line to indicate it being received
  Serial.print("This just in ... ");
  // Print out the received character
  Serial.println(receivedChar);
  // Turn the LED on

            The Arduino code was largely borrowed from the L8 and L9 lectures. The Serial character receiving and detecting
            was borrowed from the Arduino Forum megathread "Serial Input Basics" (https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=288234.0). 
            The code first forms an array with sensor data from the control joystick. Then, it sends that over to the webpage via Serial.
            Then, the program proceeds to check if anything was received from the webpage via Serial. The program only checks for 
            mouse presses to turn on and off the yellow LED light—keeping it simple! The use of local and global variables ultimately 
            helped make this program possible.

            The code is borrowed from the HCDE 439 GitHub repository, specifically Example 2 (https://github.com/machineagency/hcde439/blob/master/p5-examples-and-addons/hcde439-example2/sketch.js)
            that was gone over during class. I had originally hoped to create a cooler ball bouncing animation with a fading tail, but I couldn't 
            get the color values to update correctly after a couple hours, and decided to switch to more of what was already provided to us.
            I was, however, able to change the line colors to be more representative of UW's brand identity—purple and gold. 
            In addition, the event listening function for mouse pressed was added. Console printouts were included throughout the program 
            to better understand and debug any errors that might occur. Note: the joystick has values from 0-1023, corresponding to the amount of tilt, 
            so the values in each direction in the program were mapped to the maximum height of the canvas to prevent out-of-bounds drawing, 
            which wouldn't look too good since we wouldn't be able to see the combination of purple and gold spikes as easily or prominently.  
            The mousePressed documentation may be found here: https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Element/mousePressed. Lastly, the UW brand colors 
            were sourced from the brand guidelines here: https://www.washington.edu/brand/graphic-elements/primary-color-palette/.

        Here, the program is seen running. The Serialcontrol is operating with a stable connection to the USB modem port as displayed by the GUI. 
        The Arduino program is also seen open, as it was the program uploaded to run in the Arduino. Lastly, the local webpage is open 
        to show the graph being drawn and the mouse being pressed. Lots of things working together to make sure the webpage and Arduino can 
        communicate with each other. They say communication in real life is hard, but wow, it doesn't get easier in the digital realm either!
